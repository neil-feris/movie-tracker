# Introduction

The purpose of this app is to provide users with a simple and intuitive way to search for movies and save their favorites in personalized lists. The app will use the TMDB API to get the latest and most accurate information about movies, and will allow users to create and manage their own lists of movies.

The app will be built using the MERN stack, which consists of MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js. This stack is well-suited for building full-stack web apps that are fast, scalable, and easy to develop and deploy.

The frontend of the app will be built with React and Material-UI, which will provide a modern and user-friendly interface. The backend will be an Express server, which will handle API requests, authentication, and database operations. The app's data will be stored in a MongoDB database, which is a flexible and scalable document-oriented database.

Overall, this app will provide a simple and efficient way for users to discover and save their favorite movies, and will be built using the latest and most popular web development technologies.

## System architecture:

- A React frontend, which provides the user interface and user interactions for the app
- An Express server, which serves as the backend and handles API requests, authentication, and database operations
- A MongoDB database, which stores the app's data, including user accounts and movie lists
- The TMDB API, which provides the movie information that is displayed in the app
- In this architecture, the React frontend communicates with the Express server using API calls. The Express server then queries the MongoDB database and the TMDB API to get the necessary data, and sends it back to the frontend to be displayed.

## System Requirements Specification:

### User Requirements

- Users must be able to create an account using email and password, Facebook, or Google.
- Users must be able to login and logout of their account.
- Users must be able to search for movies by title, actor, director, or genre.
- Users must be able to view the details of a movie, including the title, release date, cast, and plot summary.
- Users must be able to create and save lists of movies, with a custom name and description.
- Users must be able to view and manage their saved lists of movies, including updating the list name and description, and adding or removing movies from the list.
- Users must be able to share their lists of movies with other users by generating a shareable link.

Overall, these user requirements will provide the core functionality of the app, and will allow users to easily search for and save their favorite movies in personalized lists.

### System Requirements

- Allow users to login and logout of their account
- Allow users to search for movies using the TMDB API
- Allow users to create and save lists of movies
- Allow users to view the details of a movie, such as the title, release date, cast, and plot summary
- Allow users to update and delete their lists of movies
- Persist user data and lists of movies in a MongoDB database
- Provide a user-friendly and visually appealing interface using Material-UI
- Allow users to share their lists of movies with other users by generating a shareable link

### Non-functional requirements:

- The app must be secure, with proper authentication and authorization to prevent unauthorized access to user data
- The app must be scalable, so it can handle an increasing number of users and requests without performance degradation
- The app must be responsive, so it can be used on a variety of devices with different screen sizes and resolutions
- The app must have good performance, with fast page load times and smooth user interactions

### External Interface Requirements

- The app must use the TMDB API (https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api) to get movie information.
- The app must use a MongoDB database (https://www.mongodb.com/) to store user accounts and movie lists.

### Other Non-Functional Requirements

- The app must use a modern and user-friendly design, following the Material Design guidelines.
- The app must use proper coding standards and design patterns, following best practices for React, Node.js, and MongoDB.
- The app must be well-documented, with clear and concise code comments and a comprehensive README file.

Overall, these non-functional requirements will ensure that the app is accessible, usable, and maintainable. They will also ensure that the app has a consistent and professional appearance, and that the code is well-organized and easy to understand.

### User Stories

- As a new user, I want to create an account so that I can save my favorite movies and access them from any device.
- As a regular user, I want to search for movies by title, actor, director, or genre, so that I can find the movies that I am interested in.
- As a regular user, I want to view the details of a movie, such as the title, release date, cast, and plot summary, so that I can learn more about the movie and decide whether to save it to my list.
- As a regular user, I want to create and save lists of movies, with a custom name and description, so that I can organize my favorite movies and share them with others.
- As a regular user, I want to update and delete my lists of movies, so that I can keep my movie lists current and relevant.
- As a regular user, I want to share my lists of movies with other users, by generating a shareable link, so that I can discuss and share my favorite movies with my friends and family.
- As an admin user, I want to be able to delete any user account, so that I can remove users who violate the app's terms of service.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, this describes the functional and non-functional requirements for a MERN stack app that allows users to search for and save their favorite movies. The app will use the TMDB API to get the latest and most accurate movie information, and will allow users to create and manage their own lists of movies.

The app will be built using the MERN stack, which consists of MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js. This stack is well-suited for building full-stack web apps that are fast, scalable, and easy to develop and deploy.

The app will also use Material-UI for the frontend, Passport.js for authentication, and Mongoose for database operations. These tools and technologies will provide a modern and user-friendly app that is secure, performant, and accessible.
